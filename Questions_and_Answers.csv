Question, Did I build off of Faraday’s electroplating work and the number of coulombs per mole?, is a uniform electric field important to my experiment?, Is a non uniform electric field important to my experiment?, Did my discovery reveal the structure of the atom like how the mass of the electron is significantly smaller than the mass of the proton/ nucleus?, Did I build off of Einstein’s work?, Did I work with situations you would use the 3rd hand rule for?, Did lots of my work occur in the mid 19th century?,Is the understanding of charges with a velocity and how their magnetic fields interact important for what I did?, Did my work largely have to do with electrical engineering and the application of science?, Was my notable work done in the late 18th century?, Did I discover electromagnetic induction in the early 1830s?, Did my research study or use the first hand rule?, Did my research or area of study have to do with the link between electricity and magnetism?, Did I try to measure the speed of light?, Was I the one of the first people to try to measure the speed of light?, Was my experiment that attempted to measure the speed of light done in the 17th century?, Did I prove the speed of light was finite?, Was the diameter of Earth's orbit used as the distance in the equation that solves for the speed of light?, Could a source of error in my experiment be inaccurate measurements of Earths and Jupiters orbit?, Could a manipulated variable in my experiment be when the measurements of Io and Jupiter are taken throughout the year?, Did I use my own data for my calculations of the speed of light?, Did I predict that EMR could be made in a lab?, Does my work focus on the wave-like properties of light?, Does my work focus on the particle-like properties of light?, Did my work to show the particle properties of light go on to define the start of modern physics?, Could a source of error in my experiment be measuring the frequency of a rotating object?, Are my math equations still heavily used today?, Does my work relate to particle-wave duality? Does it describe particles as waves?
