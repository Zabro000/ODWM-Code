Question, Did I build off of Faraday’s electroplating work and the number of coulombs per mole?, is a uniform electric field important to my experiment?, Is a non uniform electric field important to my experiment?, Did my discovery reveal the structure of the atom like how the mass of the electron is significantly smaller than the mass of the proton/ nucleus?, Did I build off of Einstein’s work?, Did I work with situations you would use the 3rd hand rule for?, Did lots of my work occur in the mid 19th century?,Is the understanding of charges with a velocity and how their magnetic fields interact important for what I did?, Did my work largely have to do with electrical engineering and the application of science?, Was my notable work done in the late 18th century?, Did I discover electromagnetic induction in the early 1830s?, Did my research study or use the first hand rule?, Did my research or area of study have to do with the link between electricity and magnetism?
